- Salvador Dalí (surrealist painter) he was the definition of a crazy guy

- the method he uses to create art is relax on a chair and let her mind go free, and sometimes remembering her previous focus, with a key in his hand for when he sleep the key fall in the ground and wake him up so he can get that conections of the defuse mode and go to the focused mode bringing the new connections
- this is not so good only for art, but for other areas
- Thomas Edison he makes the same of Slvador Dlí 
- so when you are learning new things you need to go back and forth of the difused and focused mode 
- you need to think as lifting wheights, you need to train every day, so you can compete, it doesnt work only workout on the day
- you need a little work every day
- to build neural structure you need to do a little work every day
- learning something difficult takes time
