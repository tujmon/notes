- long term memory and working memory
- working memory is related to what needs to be processed imediatedly an consciously
- the working memory is more concentrated in the prefrontal cortex, near your eyes
- but it has some influences in other places to access the long term memory
- working memory can hold only 4 chunks of informations
- you need to use repetition to store memory in the long term memory , like what we do to a phone number
- so short term memory is like a bad black board
- and long term memory is like a storage and is stored in different areas of the brain
- but you need practice at least a few times to remember
- long term memory is where we store fundaments and other things we are learning
- so when you are learning something new you use your working memory and to change for long term memory it requires practice and time
- you can use spaced repetition to remember what you learned
