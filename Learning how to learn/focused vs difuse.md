- learn more easily knowing how your brain works
- we have two modes of thinking **focused** and **defused** mode
- focused is when you concentrated in something you learn or understand
- defused is more related to resting states
- metaphor and analogy are helpful when trying to learn something new
- when e are in focused mode our neurons are "near each other"
- this is good when we are familiar with the subject
- when we try to find a path we dont know is more dificult because they are near each other so its easy to bump in things we already know
- so to create new ideas is more easy to use the difuse mode, because we can move with a big picture
- or you are in difuse mode or in focused mode, but never in both sides
